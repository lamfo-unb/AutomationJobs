<p style="width: 80%;position: relative;right: -10%;">
This work had the objective of reproducing the methodology of Frey and Osborne (2017) to obtain the probabilities of automation of the occupations in Brazil.
"The reports are of great relevance to health professionals and professionals who promote their careers as promoters of good working practices in the country."
The tasks can be executed, the companies can be automated, in addition they realize that the professions with greater risk of automation present a tendency of growth over time that can result in a higher level of work in the next years if the executives and the state is not prepared for this scenario.
</p>
<p><i> Key-words:</i> Automation, occupation, risk.</p>

<h2 id="introducao">1. Introduction</h2>
</center>
<p>The managerial environment has undergone drastic changes in its functional structure due to the insertion of new technologies in the organizations. Algorithms and automation through machine learning have become increasingly common, mainly due to the competition among firms for increasing production and reducing costs.
</p>
<p>
In this sense, managers need to be aware of these new technologies and how their organizations can benefit from the implementation of those systems. Consequently, a change in the business paradigm and in the way in which the hiring of employees, or the replacement of these by machines, is the object of study of this work.</p>
<p>
Automation has become the biggest fear of people employed in recent years, both in developed and underdeveloped countries. There is widespread concern today that Machine Learning technologies will create mass unemployment over the next few years.</p>
<p>For example, in March 2018, employees of the Brazilian Postal and Telegraph Company declared a strike. One of the demands of the strikers was the return of a position eliminated by the management of the agency, which was responsible for manually selecting and checking each package / letter and then separating those packages according to the destination <span class="citation">(Cavallini, <a href="#ref-Cavallini2018">2018</a>)</span>. 
This demand was motivated after the occupants of these posts were dismissed or relocated in other tasks after the automation in the production process of the Post. The era of automation in Brazil aligns with the findings of <span class="citation">David (<a href="#ref-david2015there">2015</a>)</span>, 
about the perfect substitutability between human performance at the middle level and the technology currently available.</p>
<p>
Another similar situation that could be avoided with automation was the 2018 truckers strike in Brazil. This national road stop caused a shortage of food, medicines and oil throughout Brazil, with long lines of vehicles for gas stations <span class="citation">(Bloomberg, <a href="#ref-bloomberg">2018</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>
In addition, the large and heavy Brazilian government, with its culture of paternalism and inefficiency of <span class="citation">Bank (<a href="#ref-worldbank2017">2017</a>)</span>, is becoming a great opportunity for the replacement of many routine manual labor performed in the public sector <span class="citation">David (<a href="#ref-david2015there">2015</a>)</span>. In this way, the emergence of resistance against the use of machines from trade unions and associations is natural.
</p>
<p>
To monitor this recent paradigm shift in the US job market <span class="citation">Dvorkin (<a href="#ref-dvorkin2016jobs">2016</a>)</span> presented the evolution of four types of work: routine manual; non-routine manual; cognitive routine; cognitive behavior. In his article
 <span class="citation">Dvorkin (<a href="#ref-dvorkin2016jobs">2016</a>)</span> shows that the number of routine manual and cognitive routine jobs is not growing as fast as possible, and one explanation for this is the level of automation that has been increasing in recent years. This difference between the four types of jobs may produce, in the near future, more inequality and unemployment in Brazil if no public policy is taken.</p>
<p>One question that is continuously investigated is whether the new technologies are really responsible for a decade of low job growth in Brazil and the world. According to
 <span class="citation">Rotman (<a href="#ref-rotman2013technology">2013</a>)</span>, 
many economists argue that the results produced in recent years are inconclusive as there are many other plausible explanations, such as financial crises.</p>
<p>On the other hand, <span class="citation">C. B. Frey &amp; Osborne (<a href="#ref-frey2017future">2017</a>)</span>, postulate that all occupations, rather than unique tasks, are automated by technological advances. In their article, they found that 47% of all US jobs may be at risk of being automated in the near future. His point of view was more pessimistic than other authors, however, it is the most cited article on the subject today.</p>
<p>The authors focused on the technological advances in what they call Machine Learning - ML. His assumption is that this organizational age in which we live is different from other technological revolutions, because machines are now capable of performing tasks that until recently were considered to be genuinely human, as routine, as well as non-routine, tasks.</p>
<p><span class="citation">Brynjolfsson &amp; McAfee (<a href="#ref-brynjolfsson2014second">2014</a>)</span> agree with <span class="citation">C. B. Frey &amp; Osborne (<a href="#ref-frey2017future">2017</a>)</span>. They suggest that because of the automation of some routine cognitive tasks, new technologies can increasingly serve as substitutes rather than just as complement to the workers who perform these tasks.</p>
<p>In the optimistic paradigm
 <span class="citation">Alexopoulos &amp; Cohen (<a href="#ref-alexopoulos2016medium">2016</a>)</span>, for example, argue that historically positive technological shocks have increased employment opportunities. In this way, automation could, in the long run, be good for the whole economy.</p>
<p>
In addition, ML methods are as good as your training sample and should consider large data sets with thousands of examples available so that the quality of the machine developed is good enough. The quality of data in most companies in the underdeveloped countries is very low, or these firms do not record their data. This makes it impossible to automate the tasks, since there is no data and when there are these are very bad.</p>
<p>Based on this scenario, this study contributes to the international literature on automation and employment, studying the evolution of the number of jobs in Brazil over time and space related to the degree of automation, using classes built by the Department of Labor from the USA.<span class="citation">(DOL, <a href="#ref-onet">1998</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Our objective is to answer some questions regarding the rate of increase (or decrease) of types of jobs classified by the degree of automation of each position. Specifically, we present which work zone has the largest increase and the lowest decrease in the number of positions in Brazil, also using the Geographic Information System (GIS), we study this evolution in space, localizing spatial clusters of increase and decrease of these positions in Brazil microregions.</p>

</center>
<p>The study on automation and scanning and how these scenarios can affect jobs around the world is continuously updated year by year. This statement is in accordance with what has been by <span class="citation">Raj &amp; Seamans (<a href="#ref-raj2018ai">2018</a>)</span>. <span class="citation">Raj &amp; Seamans (<a href="#ref-raj2018ai">2018</a>)</span> states that the current body of empirical literature around the robotics and adoption of Machine Learning by organizations is growing and often trying to answer similar questions: Will automation be the end of traditional work? Some discrepancies, however, have been found in several studies and these discrepancies evidence the need for further investigations, replication articles, and more complete and detailed data. </p>
<p>In addition, these new technological advances have led to both motivation about the ability of machine learning algorithms and automation to drive economic growth, as well as concern for the fate of human workers in a world in which computer algorithms can perform many of the human functions <span class="citation">(Furman, <a href="#ref-furman2016time">2016</a>)</span>. Nesse sentido, <span class="citation">Raj &amp; Seamans (<a href="#ref-raj2018ai">2018</a>)</span> 
reported that recent academic research suggests that automation and robotics may have accounted for about a tenth of the increase in the USA gross domestic product (GDP) between 1993 and 2007 <span class="citation">(Graetz &amp; Michaels, <a href="#ref-graetz2017modern">2017</a>)</span> but also a decrease in the number of jobs <span class="citation">(C.

Another definition is given by <span class="citation">Chui, Manyika, &amp; Miremadi (<a href="#ref-chui2015four">2015</a>)</span> who evaluated the "automatism" of these capabilities through the use of state-of-the-art technology, adjusting the level of capacity required for occupations where work occurs in unpredictable configurations.</p>
<p>The main articles on this subject reported by the scientific literature are the works of <span class="citation">C. B. Frey &amp; Osborne (<a href="#ref-frey2013future">2013</a>)</span> e <span class="citation">C. B. Frey &amp; Osborne (<a href="#ref-frey2017future">2017</a>)</span>. <span class="citation">C. B. Frey &amp; Osborne (<a href="#ref-frey2017future">2017</a>)</span> estimated the susceptibility of employment to computerization. In their paper, the authors classify occupations in the USA with respect to the risk of being susceptible to automation by asking experts about the technological potential of automation in the near future and applying a Gaussian Process Classifier to 702 occupations. This was done through the a priori classification of some occupations labeled by experts and the extrapolation of the probability for all data. As a result, <span class="citation">C. B. Frey &amp; Osborne (<a href="#ref-frey2017future">2017</a>)</span> 
reported that 47% of all people employed in the US are working on jobs that could be run by computers in the next 10 to 20 years.</p>
<p>A similar idea to that is proposed by <span class="citation">C. B. Frey &amp; Osborne (<a href="#ref-frey2017future">2017</a>)</span> was applied to other countries.. <span class="citation">Pajarinen, Rouvinen, &amp; others (<a href="#ref-pajarinen2014computerization">2014</a>)</span> 
suggests that 35.7% of jobs in Finland are at high risk for automation, <span class="citation">DiBa (<a href="#ref-diba2015roboter">2015</a>)</span> 
estimates that the share of jobs at risk of automation reaches 59% in Germany, <span class="citation">Bowles (<a href="#ref-bowles2014computerisation">2014</a>)</span> 
that the share of jobs that are susceptible to automation in Europe ranges from 45% to more than 60% and <span class="citation">Arntz, Gregory, &amp; Zierahn (<a href="#ref-arntz2016risk">2016</a>)</span> 
estimated the automation of the work of the 21 countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).</p>
<p>In our perspective, the most comprehensive work on the topic is due to
 <span class="citation">Arntz et al. (<a href="#ref-arntz2016risk">2016</a>)</span>. In their paper, the authors take into account the heterogeneity of the occupational tasks of the occupations and found that, on average, in the 21 OECD countries, 9% of jobs are automated. However, the authors found heterogeneity among the OECD countries and pointed out that, while the share of automated jobs is 6% in Korea, the corresponding share is 12% in Austria, this difference according to the authors may be a reflection of the differences in work organizations, or because of the educational level of these workers in all countries. <span class="citation">Arntz et al. (<a href="#ref-arntz2016risk">2016</a>)</span> in fact he did not study Brazil, which is not a member of the OECD. In this way, there is the possibility of addressing a gap in this field of study using national data.
</p>
<p><span class="citation">Arntz et al. (<a href="#ref-arntz2016risk">2016</a>)</span> also found that, despite the differences, the main characteristic of all OECD countries is that automation capacity often decreases with the level of education as well as the income of workers. For all types of employees, <span class="citation">Arntz et al. (<a href="#ref-arntz2016risk">2016</a>)</span> suggest that the low-skilled and income-poor are those who face a greater risk of having their jobs automated, this result is in agreement with the findings

<p><span class="citation">Goos, Manning, &amp; Salomons (<a href="#ref-goos2014explaining">2014</a>)</span> e <span class="citation">David &amp; Dorn (<a href="#ref-david2013growth">2013</a>)</span> have found that in the US and Europe has been the "polarization" of employment by skill level the main cause of income inequality among all types of occupations.</p>
<p><span class="citation">Acemoglu &amp; Restrepo (<a href="#ref-acemoglu2017robots">2017</a>)</span> examine the impact of increased industrial automation on US labor markets between 1990 and 2007. The authors found that automation in the United States is negatively correlated with employment and wages during 1990 and 2007. <span class="citation">Acemoglu &amp; Restrepo (<a href="#ref-acemoglu2017robots">2017</a>)</span> also estimated that each additional machine reduced employment by six workers and that a new robot per thousand workers reduced wages by 0.5 percent. This effect, according to the authors, is more pronounced in manufacturing, particularly in manual and routine manual occupations (routine cognitive tasks) and for workers without a university degree.</p>
<p>In the same direction, <span class="citation">J. Bessen (<a href="#ref-bessen2018ai">2018</a>)</span> says that in the manufacturing sector, technology has drastically reduced jobs in recent decades. The author presented a demand model which predicted the rise and fall of employment in the textile, steel and automobile industries. These sectors were the most vulnerable with regard to automation.</p>
<p><span class="citation">Furman (<a href="#ref-furman2018should">2018</a>)</span>, for example, argues that while technology generates new consumption demands and consequently new jobs, the turnover caused by automation could lead to periods of high unemployment. This can be fatal to the economies of</p>
<p><span class="citation">Ramaswamy (<a href="#ref-ramaswamy2018technological">2018</a>)</span> 
summarizes most of the findings of this topic:</p>

<li><p>

</ol>
<p><span class="citation">Ramaswamy (<a href="#ref-ramaswamy2018technological">2018</a>)</span> argues that the risk of automation of work in developing countries varies across countries, for example, the author states that it is estimated to range from 55% in Uzbekistan to 85% in Ethiopia. In emerging economies, the risk of automation is estimated to be relatively high, with 77% of jobs in China and 69% in India considered at risk.
</p>
<p>
While most studies used occupational descriptions and some expert opinions, <span class="citation">Mann &amp; Püttmann (<a href="#ref-mann2017benign">2017</a>)</span> took a different approach to analyze the effects of automation on employment. In their study, the authors used in information provided by patents granted. <span class="citation">Mann &amp; Püttmann (<a href="#ref-mann2017benign">2017</a>)</span> applied a machine learning classifier algorithm to all 5 million patents granted between 1976 and 2014 to identify patents related to automation based on a sample of 560 patents manually sorted to classify patents in automation and non-automation innovations. <span class="citation">Mann &amp; Püttmann (<a href="#ref-mann2017benign">2017</a>)</span> 
concluded that while automation reduces industrial employment, employment in the service sector increases, and in general has a positive impact on employment. In the same direction, <span class="citation">Susskind &amp; others (<a href="#ref-susskind2017model">2017</a>)</span> 
argues that the number of tasks that robots can replace can be even greater.</p>
<p>Another work that presents an optimistic overview of the theme is the article by <span class="citation">J. E. Bessen (<a href="#ref-bessen2017automation">2017</a>)</span>. The author found that new technologies must have a positive effect on employment if they improve productivity in markets where there is a large amount of pent-up demand. He also suggests that new computer technology is associated with declines in employment in the industry where demand is usually achieved but correlates with employment growth in less saturated and non-manufacturing industries.</p>
<p>Another work that presents an optimistic view of the theme is the article by <span class="citation">J. E. Bessen (<a href="#ref-bessen2017automation">2017</a>)</span>. According to the author, new technologies must have a positive effect on employment if they improve productivity in markets where there is a large amount of pent-up demand. It is also suggested that the new technology is associated with declining employment in the manufacturing industry, where demand is correlated with employment growth in less saturated and non-manufacturing industries.</p>
<p>According to <span class="citation">Furman (<a href="#ref-furman2018should">2018</a>)</span>, since automation can reduce the number of jobs for less skilled jobs, this can also mean a decline in the demand for more skilled jobs. On the other hand, more skilled tasks that use problem-solving skills, creativity and intuition (non-routine cognitive tasks), as well as low-skill tasks that require situational adaptability and personal (routine cognitive) interactions, are less likely to be automated.</p>
<p>Regarding the literature review, we can see that optimistic and pessimistic scenarios are possible. If we assume that machines can only be substitutes for routine tasks <span class="citation">(Acemoglu &amp; Autor, <a href="#ref-acemoglu2011skills">2011</a>)</span>, then the result is likely to be optimistic or less pessimistic. This is explained by <span class="citation">Acemoglu &amp; Restrepo (<a href="#ref-acemoglu2016race">2016</a>)</span>, who argues that this is due to two reasons: first, because there will always be classes of occupations that will not be fully automated, and second, it is always possible to introduce new tasks in which work has a comparative advantage, as pointed out by
 <span class="citation">Acemoglu &amp; Restrepo (<a href="#ref-acemoglu2016race">2016</a>)</span>. This can compensate for the loss of occupations due to automation.</p>
<p>None of the cited articles studied Brazil and the impact of an economic crisis on the number of jobs classified by the level of complexity or probability of automation. Thus, we proposed to estimate the probability of automation of the Brazilian Classification of Occupations - CBO, associating this probability with the classification of O * NET Job Zones. The effect of the Brazilian economic crisis of 2015-2018 on the number of jobs for the five <em> Job Zones </em> defined by the O * NET classification system is also measured.</p>
<center style="padding-top:55px">
<h2 id="metodologia">3. Methodology</h2>
</center>
<p>
The database used in this study was the <i> Annual Social Information Relation </i> - RAIS. RAIS is an annual administrative database that aims to provide information to government entities with the purpose of subsidizing public labor market policies in Brazil.</p>
<p>The RAIS is a panel that covers 97% of formal workers in Brazil between 1986 and 2016 and contains other data such as income, educational level of workers, age, CBO, company identification and <i> National Classification of Economic Activities </i> - CNAE of firms besides many other regional variables. </p>
<p> Based on these data, the first step of the study was to unify the O * NET Job Zone classification with RAIS for each CBO. OO * NET is a database that features 1122 occupational groups and provides definitions and concepts to describe workers as to their skills and competences beyond the required educational level, plus 5 levels called Job Zones that rank the occupations regarding their level of preparation:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Job Zone 1 - occupations that require little preparation.</li>
<li>Job Zone 2 - occupations that require some preparation.</li>
<li>Job Zone 3 - occupations that require an intermediate level of preparation.</li>
<li>Job Zone 4 - occupations that require considerable preparation.</li>
<li>Job Zone 5 - occupations that require a high level of preparation.</li>
</ol>
<p>The idea was then to use the <i> Job Zones </i> classification as a <i> proxy </i> of the level of automation of CBOs over the years using RAIS. In fact, there is a negative relationship between the <i> Job Zones </i> classification and the automation probability presented in the O * NET base as Figure 1 points out.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
{{ Box_Paper }}
<p class="caption">
Figura 1: Probabilidade de informatização por Job Zone
</p>
</div>
<p>
Figure 1 shows the probability of automation of occupations according to <i>Job Zones</i>. The probabilities were obtained by means of the seminal text <span class="citation">C. B. Frey &amp; Osborne (<a href="#ref-frey2017future">2017</a>)</span> which inspired this work, and the correspondence was given through the standard American 2010 classification (<i> 2010 Standard Occupational Classification</i>), 
called SOC. Based on Figure 1 we can see that the more complex an occupation in terms of level of preparation, the lower the probability of automation of these occupations.</p>
<p>This seems to be consistent with the hypothesis that occupations that require a high level of preparation are more difficult to automate because there are many details in the execution of the tasks corresponding to these occupations, which restricts, at least in the short term, the chance of these occupations automated.</p>


Thus, our objective was to obtain the relation of the <i> Job Zones </i> to the national CBOs. Firstly, it is necessary to standardize the Brazilian codes for the most recent version, since in the data two CBO standardizations are declared: the first one called CBO94 which comprises from the beginning of the series to the year of 2002 and the second CBO2002 which runs from 2003 until time. From the first to the second version we see that in the latest, there is a breakdown of occupations that were previously classified under the same code. That is, we observe cases in which the correspondence of a CBO94 occurs for many CBO2002. For the assignment of CBO2002 to employees before 2003, an allocation was considered proportional to the number of employees of the occupation in 2003 over the total of employees of that year who have the same corresponding in the version of 94.



<p>
Since there is no corresponding conversion table between the national CBOs and the <i> Job Zones </i> provided by the O * NET we assign the <i> Job Zones </i> in Brazilian occupations by following steps : using the most recent version of CBOs dated 2002 whose source is <span class="citation">MTE (<a href="#ref-MTE">2018</a>)</span>, we cross this data with the <i>International Standard Classification of Occupations - <span class="citation">ISCO (<a href="#ref-ISCO">2018</a>)</span>, version 88</i>. 
This crossing allowed to connect the data directly to the <span class="citation">MTE (<a href="#ref-MTE">2018</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Once these data were unified we upgraded ISCO-88 to ISCO-08 and then it was possible to relate the <i>2008 International Standard Classification of Occupations</i> with the <span class="citation">SOC (<a href="#ref-SOC">2018</a>)</span> of 2010. Finally, <span class="citation">O*NET (<a href="#ref-ONET_">2018</a>)</span> provides the correspondence between Job Zones and SOC 2010.</p>
<p>After this process we find the <i>Job Zones</i> to 73% of the CBOs, but while the O * NET database provides 1122 occupational groups the RAIS (using CBO 2002) provides 2602 occupational groups, thus, the correspondence between these two sources results in a final database for which some occupations Have more than one correspondence with the <i>Job Zones</i>.</p>
<p>For the remaining CBOs we fill 8% of the occupational codes using the direct translation from English to Portuguese of the description of these occupations and we unified by the measure of similarity between these two texts. The measure of similarity expressed between <span class="math inline">\([0, 1]\)</span> and the ratio between the number of common elements between the two texts on the total number of words of the two texts is given twice. Finally, the remaining 19% were filled by means of manual inspection performed by the authors of this study, evaluating the level of preparation required for each occupational code based on their description of activities.</p>
<p>Next we calculate the number of workers expected in each <i>Job Zones</i> per year. Mathematically, let <span class="math inline">\(W_{i,t}\)</span> be the number of workers in the <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>-th CBO, <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> represents the year index and <span class="math inline">\(\pi_{i,j,t}\)</span> the percentage of times the <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>-th period time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> was classified as coming from a
 <i>Job Zones</i> <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>, so the expected number of workers per
 <i>Job Zones</i> and year is given by:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[E_{j,t} = W_{i,t} \pi_{i,j,t} \]</span></p>
<p>para <span class="math inline">\(j=1,\dots,5\)</span>. 
However, since the number of employees by Job Zones is very different in absolute terms (as there are many more workers whose occupations need little preparation than occupations requiring a high level of preparation), We chose to work with the <i>Cumulative Growth Rate</i> (CGR) so that it may be possible to compare the magnitudes of growth (or decrease) of these occupations over time, specifically the Cumulative Growth Rate was calculated as follows:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[G_{j,t} = \displaystyle\sum_{t_{0}=1}^{t}\left[\frac{E_{j,t_{0}}}{E_{j,t_{0}-1}}-E_{j,t_{0}-1}\right]\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(t_{0}=1\)</span> the second year of our time series, which year 1988 is the base year of comparison.</p>
<p>
Figure 2 shows the Cumulative Growth Rate of the number of employees for each <i> Job Zones </i>, as well as the Cumulative Growth Rate of the Brazilian Gross Domestic Product.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
{{ Serie_Paper }}
<p class="caption">
Figure 2: Expected rate of cumulative growth for each Job Zone and Brazilian Gross Domestic Product.
</p>
</div>
<p>If we believe that automation is actually eliminating jobs over the years, especially for the first
 <i>Job Zones</i>, we should note that the cumulative growth rate of the fifth <i>Job Zone</i> 
should surpass the curve of the <i>Job Zones</i> 4, followed by <i>Job Zones</i> 3, <i>Job Zones</i> 2 and finally <i>Job Zones</i> 1. 
Interestingly, this pattern is not represented in Figure 2.</p> <p>In fact, what is observed is that the first <i>Job Zone</i> jobs overcame Job Zones 5,4,3 and 2 in that order. The first question that arises is why the rate of <i>Job Zone</i> workers has grown more in recent years than the rate of workers in the other Job Zones, if this is the which requires a lower level of preparation than the others. Some possibilities can be presented: the first assumes that the automation of occupations is not happening in Brazil, this would explain why the curves in Figure 2 do not follow order 5,4,3,2 and 1 in their accumulated growth rates , but it does not explain why <i>Job Zones</i> 5, 4, 3 and 2 behave as expected. </p>The second and more plausible alternative is the possibility of <i>Job Zones</i> 2, 3, 4 and even 5 workers having lost their jobs in recent years due to automation and macroeconomic issues and then relocated on the job market in <i> Job Zones </i> below their original Job Zone </i>.</p>
<p>If this alternative is the correct one, something of concern should be analyzed more deeply: what will happen to these <i>Job Zones</i> if your occupations are automated? And in fact, the lower the level of <i>Job Zone</i>, the less preparation the professional must have and the greater the chance of their tasks being automated. This in line with the low cost of automation, the fact that robots do not need labor rights and can operate 24 hours a day makes the automation alternative very competitive
 <i>versus</i>manual labor, potentially eliminating many job openings in the near future.</p>
<p>
To confirm this hypothesis, we track the workers over time and measure the number of times they changed <i>Job Zone</i> over the years, which are represented by Table 1:</p>

Table 1: Percent change for the <i> Job Zone </i>> over the years.
</center>
<p>Through Table 2 we can see that the percentage change to <i> Job Zone </i> 1 is higher among Job Zone </i> 2 workers, followed by Job Zone </i> i> 3, <i> Job Zone </i> 4 and less frequently the Job Zone 5 workers. These data corroborate the hypothesis of migration to <Z> Job Zones </i> as an alternative that workers have when they lose their jobs. According to this hypothesis, it is preferable to receive less in an occupation of low preparatory level (even if the worker originally possesses a high level of preparation) than not to be working in the labor market.</p>
<p>Another issue that arises is: the decrease in the rate in GDP due to the Brazilian financial crisis affects equally the reduction of jobs for all <i>Job Zones</i> ?</p>
<p>This issue is motivated by the recent Brazilian financial crisis that was followed by a political crisis resulting in the impeachment of President Dilma Rousseff allied with popular dissatisfaction with the national political system.</p>
<p>After 2014, Brazilian GDP fell by 3.9% due to wage losses, credit restrictions, rising interest rates and high unemployment in all sectors of the economy. This decrease can be seen in Figure 2 where the Cumulative Growth Rate of employees in Job Zones also fell from 2014:</p>

Automation job research</h3> <p>Using an idea similar to that proposed by <span class="citation">C. B. Frey &amp; Osborne (<a href="#ref-frey2017future">2017</a>)</span> we collected on the Lattes platform of the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) the names of all the researchers registered in the platform and who have acted in automation projects related to Machine Learning.</p>
<p>During this process we found 754 e-mails from professionals who reported on the Lattes Platform of CNPq their work in automation projects. It is expected that these professionals for their academic performance in automation projects have the ability to classify Brazilian occupations second to their probability of automation.</p>
<p>We then invite all of these researchers to randomly evaluate CBOs for their likelihood of automation. The researchers were therefore given the name of the CBO, the description of the activities performed by this occupation and the respondent attributed a probability between 0 and 1 of the level of automation of these occupations.</p>
<p>The final database with all responses recorded 3966 responses from 69 researchers and 2046 CBOs in a population of 2602 existing CBOs. We also observed that each respondent evaluated on average 57.48 random CBOs during the data collection process.</p>

<p>Then, to estimate the final probability of automation of CBOs using the collected sample, we generated the frequency of words (unigramas and bigramas) that described each CBO observed in the sample using the descriptions of activities of these occupations.</p>
<p>These unigramas and bigramas were obtained after the removal of <i>stop-words</i>, numbers, abbreviations and punctuation totaling more than 19 thousand variables. As it is an extensive amount of characteristics that would describe the occupations, a Principal Components Analysis was carried out as a way of reducing the observed characteristics. Keeping at least 70% of variability explained we selected the first 372 major components.</p>
<p>The last step was the computation of the probability of automation for all CBOs, for which we used the collected sample and the characteristics summarized by the main components to study and evaluate a Gaussian Process model.</p>

<p>Simulating 5000 observations of Density we obtained the empirical estimate of the probability distribution of automation for each CBO. It is interesting to note in this case that the Bayesian approach provides a useful interpretation for the results obtained, since due to the high degree of uncertainties it would be better to sample observations of the a posteriori distribution of the parameter relative to the automation probability of the which simply provide a single point estimate. </p>
<p> In addition, the greater the variability of this parameter (calculated using the samples generated from the <i>posteriori</i> distribution of the automation probability), the greater the heterogeneity among the workers of said CBO, in other words , a high variability would represent that there is diversity of activities in the target occupation that can be easily automated and others would hardly be automated. Since a low variability in the samples generated by the a posteriori distribution of the probability of automation would represent that this CBO group is very homogeneous internally the possibly all (or most) of the professionals allocated in this CBO can have their automated activities ( when the median probability of automation is high), or that its activities could not be easily automated (if the median probability of automation is low)..</p>

<p> In this sense, based on the medians of the a posteriori distribution of the probability of automation estimated by means of the Gaussian Process, the occupations listed in the CBO were distributed among 4 classes according to their respective automation risks, namely: </p>
<ol style = "list-style-type: decimal">
<li> Very Low Automation - 1st quartile of probability median; </li>
<li> Low Automation - 2nd quartile of probability median; </li>
<li> High Automation - 3rd quartile of probability median; </li>
<li> Very High Automation - 4th quartile of probability median. </li>
</ol>


<p> Of the 46,281,590 workers formally employed on 12/31/2017, 61,672 are with their respective CBOs registered as missing values ​​(NAs) in the RAIS of 2017. As a result, these workers did not enter in the computation of the percentage reported due to the impossibility of the pairing in the integration of analyzed databases, resulting in 46,219,918 employees. Of this remaining number, another 360,769 workers are in the CBOs that do not have Occupational Profile (for example, military occupations), for which no automation probabilities were assigned. Therefore, the total number of employees considered for the calculation of the percentage was 45,859,149. </p>

<p> Adding the "high" and "very high" automation probability levels, the number of employees belonging to these categories in 2017 was equal to 24,970,587, which represented 54.45% in a population of 45,859,149 formal employees in CBOs with occupational profile in that year. </p>

<p> Despite the seemingly alarming percentage of professions at risk in the near future, there are several transformational scenarios to consider in the dynamics of the Brazilian labor market: on the one hand, typically routine and non-cognitive activities, such as elevator operators, must in fact automated. However, other professions that integrate both easily automated subtasks and subtasks difficult to execute by robots must undergo transformations due to the development of technology and artificial intelligence - the tendency is for these occupations to be increasingly focused on tasks that are intensive in creativity and analysis critical and gradually move away from routine and repetitive activities: professions such as secretaries and accountants fit into this category. </p>

<p> Regarding the limits of the automation of jobs, occupations associated with human values ​​such as empathy (social workers), care (nannies) and subjective interpretation (arts critic) should be maintained in the short / medium term, even with the rise of leading technologies . As observed in the analyzes of the present study, occupations that have in their descriptions terms associated to these virtues resulted, in general, in low values ​​for the estimated probability of automation. Lastly. the development of new technologies in and of itself represents the emergence of new needs and, consequently, the creation of new professions associated with supervising, maintaining, and enhancing newly introduced technologies.</p>

In order to estimate the total number of jobs at risk in the next 30 years, we estimated an <i> Autoregressive integrated moving average </i> - ARIMA model for the time series of each CBO between 1986 and 2016 by linearly interpolating any point missing in those years. The estimates were obtained through the proposal of..</p>
<p>Figure 3 shows the total number of employees observed and predicted by the ARIMA model between 1986 and 2046:</p>

Figure 5: Time series of occupation by level of automation.
</p>
</div>

<p>After 2016 the data presented in Figure 5 are forecast estimates based on observed trends in the time series of the total number of employees for each CBO. We can note that the number of employees for the CBOs characterized as having a high level of automation increases over the years, assuming that the trends observed in the past will continue.
Thus, two scenarios arise: the first is that firms in Brazil maintain their same pattern of contracting regardless of the level of automation, that is, firms would mostly prefer to keep human workers in task automation, and due to this demand for employees forecasting the total number of people employed in these groups would increase. </p>
<p> The second scenario is more worrying. If companies decided to automate these professions with a high chance of automation then approximately 30 million jobs would be at risk until 2026. This scenario is the most reliable one, since the automation of tasks for the firms would produce an increase in the efficiency of their processes , cost reduction beyond the possibility of certain activities being performed 24 hours 7 days a week. </p>
<p> The challenge faced by the Brazilian government in the near future is to deal with this scenario by guaranteeing sufficient training for workers (especially low-skilled workers) to work in other branches of activities whose level of automation is lower. </p>
Furthermore, even if a sufficient number of skilled workers are available, firms decide to invest in new technologies depending on the relative factor of capital and labor prices in the performance of a particular task in the production process.</p>

<h2 id="conclusao"> 5. Conclusion </h2>

<p> The present study analyzed the dynamics of employment rates by employment zones in recent years and future trends in job automation, replicating the Frey and Osborne (2017) methodology using Brazilian data. The results of this research are consistent with those found in the recent literature, and may provide subsidies for corporate managers and policy makers to anticipate potential increases in the unemployment rate for high-risk occupations, as well as identify low-occupations risk of automation and to more accurately dimension the prospects for transforming the future configuration of the labor market. From the perspective of a firm, these insights can reshape the selection of candidates, eventually adjusting the skills required of an aspirant to the job offered; from the perspective of the federal sphere, the results can aid in the planning of economic and social policies, such as directing the focus of technical training courses to activities with less propensity for automation, potentially avoiding an investment in graduates who have been replaced by machines in the last instance. In addition, the identification of occupations and tasks with less chance of automation, such as computational programming and creative design, can foster additional discussions in the scope of digital inclusion, democratization of knowledge and reformulation of the curricular structure of higher, middle or even basic education. </p>
<p> Regarding the future trends of specific occupations as estimated by the proposed method, the study identified two relevant factors: the probability of automation of said employment and the future projection of growth of the demand for workers of the respective occupation for the next years: occupancy may present low or high probability of automation, as well as a future trend of increasing or decreasing the number of employees at the national level. Thus, the study mapped four scenarios that may indicate future courses of action for the construction of public policies directed to the respective sectors. As an illustration, we have listed an occupation example for each scenario:</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li> Active telemarketing operator: high propensity to automation and trend of demand expansion; </li>
<li> Research and development director: low propensity for automation and trend of demand expansion; </li>
<li> Administrative manager: low propensity to automation and downward trend of demand; </li>
<li> Collective transport collector: high propensity to automation and tendency to decrease demand.
</li>
</ol>

<p> As a public policy recommendation, an investment priority could be the second category activities that represent professions with potential demand that need to be filled by workers with difficult automation skills, whereas activities with a tendency to expand and a high probability of replacing a human worker by machines or robots can be potential niches of unemployment for the next few years, a finding that can enhance the effectiveness of government actions of active intervention.</p>
<p> In addition, the present study identified the existence of subtasks that may influence the estimated value for the probability of automation of a given occupation. Taking as an example the "accountant" profession, whose estimated automation probability was 48.74%: analyzing the description of this occupation in the CBO, it is possible to identify skills that are potentially easy to automate, such as "Fill out specific forms inherent to company activity "And" Calculating economic and financial ratios "; however, at the same time the profession involves tasks of difficult automation, such as "Advising business management", "Intermediating agreements with trade unions" and "Demonstrating flexibility". Thus, it was found that the probability of automation of this occupation is not in fact a "median" value; rather, this value is credited with the existence of more or less complex skills intrinsic to the same class of work. Similar standards were identified in the "legal counsel" profession, which presented an estimated automation probability of 54.09%: similarly, the skills associated with this profession encompass more easily automated tasks, such as "Gather basic documentation" and "Act promptly" , as well as tasks difficult to substitute by a machine, such as "Interpreting the legal norm", "Demonstrating creativity" and "Evidence of verbal eloquence". </p>
<p> The finding of more or less automated subtasks and their relative importance in the exercise of the occupation in question can help in the identification of the limits of the automation of tasks, as well as in the understanding of man's role in the development of artificial intelligence. Indeed, scientific papers such as Arntz, Gregory, and Zierahn (2017) argue that predicted levels of general work automation may actually be overestimating the share of automated jobs by neglecting the potentially substantial heterogeneity of subtasks within a single occupation as well such as the adaptability of jobs to digital transformation and technological developments and their massification. </p>
<p> As future developments, a more in-depth investigation is suggested of the results set forth in Figure 2, regarding the marked growth rate of Job Zone 1, which requires lower qualification levels. A more detailed analysis in light of the labor economy, as well as economic, political and social events that could have influenced the dynamics of the Brazilian labor market during the analyzed period, are of potential value for the deepening of the discussion presented in this text. Another limitation consisted in having limited the list of professionals and academics consulted to specialists in machine learning; in future applications, professionals working in other areas - such as administrators, psychologists, people managers, engineers, computer scientists, etc. - would constitute a more representative group that could refine the estimates made. Other suggestions for future research include the use of alternative machine learning techniques to the Gaussian process employed, testing of other Kernel functions, use of n-grams instead of unrammas and bigramas, and a cut-off of 70% in the analysis of main components in order to capture other key terms that may indicate greater or lesser propensities for automation. In spite of the high computational demand demanded in these proposed extensions, these can reveal patterns and tendencies not evidenced in the chosen configurations for the execution of this study.</p>
